<h1> Is Drupal any good ?</h1>

<h2>The answer would be yes from ecommerce or blogging viewpoint </h2>

It can in all cases load faster than the standard Wordpress without any plugins added into Wordpress or any other improvement done straight Content management system vs the other Drupal comes out a head overall

It does have extensions like Wordpress has plugins but none of them seem to have  the usual bad coder involved so they will normally well and not give you major speed issues which a lot of Wordpress plugins do overall

You can do many things from just standard Drupal regarding copy and pasting in codes work well most of the time if not just a quick recode should fix most of the problems you may experience some of the time <div className="

Themes on Drupal overall look normally good and load fast in majority of cases since the people who do this will often be real website designers not just some guy who read website designing and is now the undisputed website designiner master in the world after 1 job like the usual online person now a days  full of shit.Content

It can make amazing ecommerce sites run you can easy have a site as good as like Ebay or Amazon run on this CMS this may seem overkill to you but I have seen it myself when I research Drupal more and more I found many high quality sites running of it was on Drupal 3 at the time the overall best release of Drupal to me since so many extensions or themes works on it so a very good selection if you want to use it again.Amazon

Drupal 4 was pretty bad over lack of extensions or themes would work on it for why  the Drupal founder seem to abband it for like Drupal 5 which did in some ways make sessionStorage.clear

Security on them is overall pretty good which alone is good reason to use this kind of CMS since many others are like hackers dream for how easy they can break in to them overall over like hacked Wordpress plugins being common on Wordpress overall which can get annoying sometimes but on this better CMS this problem does not exist overall.


<h3>The big problems of Drupal</h3>


<button> things like extensions or themes often under funded or under developed meaning things you may like may not work when a new update comes up or just breaks in regards to the ever changing world of website designing

</button>
<table>When it comes to upgrading Drupal it often is not simple job to just click your mouse then job done like how things work on like Wordpress or Joomla meaning going from like Drupal 3 to like Drupal 5 could take a week work depending on the size of the site or skill of the website designer</table>
Not a lot of help or support exists for drupal since most of the guides are often out of date if you want help you will often have to pay for it which you may not be able to afford or not afford at that moment of time which can mean you can't do more work on your site or someone else site some of the time
I have seen Drupal on American government sites before as well which is in a way sign of quality to me
