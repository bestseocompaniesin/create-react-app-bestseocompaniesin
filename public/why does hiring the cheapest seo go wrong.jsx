Can cost you more money to fix it such as  say you pay someone $100 to do a job  it could cost you when the person makes all the mistakes like $1000 for a real SEO or programmer or website designer to clean up the mess. A good example one of my friends hired low or fake SEO who made mess of the themes,coped use copy content,wreaked all the metags or content it went from ranking for like 1000 keywords to now just like 300 keyword it was making money now it's losing money I told him to pay someone to fix it but he still wants the cheap fix instead of the pro so he will probably come back with the same problems or even worse problems now I told this person many times about  why to not hire cheap or low quality instead pay right and get right service in most cases.
Whenever I hear SEO complaints it seems to more less always come back to paying people to little in all my experiences
 so far . SEO can be simple or complex if you want to hire someone and you don't understand SEO then hire someone with good track record when possible such as checkout there Google reviews or ask other people about the person or agency if it seems good then hire them don't always just hire the  first who emails which can often lead to programs. Hacked links are often what low priced wanna be SEO do which can cause problems SEO wise or legal in more extreme cases as well so pay right and get the best person or agency to get you the sales or ranking you want when possible</textarea>


<textarea name=" if  everyone charges is like $100 for guest posts and another guy wants to charge like $5 for it does this not seem to cheap to be true well it will be often in instead it will be pbns they own or resell to you meaning if the pbn network gets disindexed or they stop payin your rankings can go often fast
 Gurantee rankings don't really exist remember no one can controll Google except them so if a person says they can gurantee you will rank in like 1 month it will probably often not work and you as possible client should  know if possible that no one can gurantee  rankings do don't pay and expect instant ranking that is not how SEO works overall you can get fast ranking true but it's not guranteed nothing in life is really overall except being born and death" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
