Why exactly did I move from WordPress to Reactjs?

Wordpress comes with the following big problems which include

Bad SEO conditions which include

Slow load Time
Most themes look boring or basic looking overall
Plugins often make the site load slower and slower and when HTML or other real coding things don't work on this does not help the problem to me and many other people
Cost more to host on Wordpress over the bloated CMS system it const [first 
    , setfirst 
] = useState(second)
Out of date Php from like 1994 it was based on
Being a real website designer or coder means I can move to better systems whenever I want more less 
I would recommend to other SEO or online  business people don't get married to a Content management system it should not be like your wife or husband just tool you use for work some of the time
Not designed or work well on Ecommerce you may now say  or think what about Woo-commerce loads super slow overall and it often has issues which does not help much
I love the copy and paste idea on Wordpress this often fails or goes wrong over the bad design of this CMS which does not help improve things for anyone overall.Bad

Codes like Adsense often don't work well on this for example on Blogger they work perfect when it's free it does make me  wonder why more people don't  use blooger instead when you consider you got like one of the fastest  server in the world and when it's free you can't really fault that overall and you can change it over theme or design wise very easy overall.

You can get design on Css file on full HTML  but Wordpress by theme or other things which does not help much load time wise again big SEO flaw or problem with regards to this kind of system for designing your online business overall

For website to look good design wise and SEO wise we all need a way to be able to use full HTML to do things which can simple be create a table or something  else for example on Wordpress tables often look bad or fail SEO wise over the limitations of the content management system behind Wordpress which is quite big flaw overall.Adsense

Security on Wordpress is so bad or weak it's not even funny average 12 year  to 18 year old without being a real hacker or super smart can break into Wordpress so easy it's like the world easiest to hack CMS system in the world moress if you are going to say but Wordfence is amazing right it helps sure but average hacker could break through it within 1 hour probably in most cases so if you are away from work or your staff is prepare to get unpleasant surprise someday often Wordfence wise
Many of Wordpress themes or plugins are hacked this even includes from I guess you could call them respected business since Wordpress is so easy to hack not a lot of they can to do to a stop attack or hack when it happens I am afraid  to say
