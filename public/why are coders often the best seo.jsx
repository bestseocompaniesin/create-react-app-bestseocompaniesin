<title> Why are coders often the best SEO?</title>

<textarea name="When it comes to how websites or search engines like Google or Bing or Yandex they are created by coders meaning if someone is a coder it should make more sense to them than non coder in most cases For example lets say we experience a Google update today or another moment in time we then find out are site takes a negative reaction from it so then we decide we should see if we can learn about the programming part of the update we can  then see what Google has stated online about it they will often not tell the whole truth or talk bs about it but they will still often include a small amount of truth within the lies so we could then learn the update is regarding Javascript for example so then we need to change are javascript to make it work better for the update to pass without problems on are sites or client sites a like or we could simply remove the problem area " id="" cols="30" rows="5"></textarea>

Many CMS often contain programming errors this can range from small to big problems meaning if one does exist this could wreak your traffic say you go from like 10,000 keywords down to like 1,000

Most SEO will use softwares often on even daily basic most of the time so think about it like this  we buy a software today it works pretty  good but we find out it's only running  at like 10 speed instead of the max of 50 so we then change it to that so now it runs a lot faster meaning we can get work done at like 5 times as before.

Their maybe a  really  amazing software we like but the creator has stopped maintaining it for some reason  so we decide to  create are own form meaning we get benefits of the past creation but at better level since it's now made to suit are own SEO needs here.

A good SEO should want to automate as much as possible to make work go faster or simply more efficient  that is what all SEO should try and aim to do on regular basic.A

When I do a SEO job small or large I am always looking for better ways to do it from a SEO or program or website design viewpoint as such I will always look for ways to do better software a like.

To share you some examples I did before include this

Reprogrammed a software to find me backlinks
Scrapebox made it run faster by changing the setting or doing bit of reprogramming to it
Wordpress you can make faster if you can remove uneeded  parts from the CMS I would not recommend you do this unless you are good programmer or can handle it could go great or terrible for you  or it could destory your website so  do it on fresh site to start with so any mistakes happen it can be fixed if the need comes up for things. 
created a mini indexer to allow sites to index faster
removed javascript since for Google it can often oddly not understand this software language right so removing it can be smart some of the time
Found expired domains at record fast speeds for me
softwares are often designed with the programmer being forced to work to fast as such some errors may exist in the software you bought or got for free if that is the case spending some time working on it could make it work a lot faster or even perform more features some of the time.

Most of the world best SEO or SEO agency are programmer or have programmers in there team since this can make giant difference sales or SEO wise overall
