I have learned from this app that React was actually created by a Facebook employee in like 2005 which I did not know before using this phone app which alone shows you smart people behind this app 
I also learned react is Javascript library before using this I would be none  the wiser of this important factor.CMS
It is also based on Javascript so why not just use Javascript is very  unfriendly normally for search engines like Google but if you use instead React Js it has the benefits of Javascript but without the problems we normally experience in regards too using this wonderful coding language 

Case you don't know I introduced to this software react by a very kind Indian man who I am friends with who told me in Telegram chat it's amazing software and when this guy is full time coder and created his own crypto I can be sure this Indian friend is right or telling the truth and I have seen his works he's amazing guy who works for like $25 per hour doing coding jobs at the moment.

The app has 4 sections which include Basic Tutorial and Advance Tutorial and Interview Q A which is designed to help you pass test for a job which I found highly intellignet to include this in a training app personally.

React Materials gives you recommendations of ebooks you can read yourself for further studying into this wonderful  software as well
