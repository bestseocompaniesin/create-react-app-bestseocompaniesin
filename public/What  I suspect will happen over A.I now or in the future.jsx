<title> What  I suspect will happen over A.I now or in the future</title>

<h1> Some  issues I have seen so far</h1>

<textarea name="
I have noticed and seem  quite a lot of sites using A.I content normally from Jasper which are existing big ranking loses at the moment such as one site I saw lost 49% of there traffic which maybe connected to the current Google update going on possibly as well
When it comes to A.I content some can be great or  bad or okay as such it's down to checking using a real person for seeing if the content a good read or bad read but many of  them will often post low quality content or content which does not make sense overall.
You will also find in a lot of cases it's about who makes the most content will win the rankings if you do it right meaning it's not really about skills just who uses the software the most will win often contenting ranking factors
I suspect Google will now or very soon make A.I content not work well or fully stop working when people all do one thing it becomes kind of clear to what's going on Google does employ people to join groups I did know who monitor what SEO do and when many people are like sheep who copy all the time the idea of some sort of guru who will often not be to smart so then Google will make  a update to stop working then people need to restart with new ideas
Most people who do SEO are always looking for a quick shortcut which can be fine short term but long term it will ofte fail I have found in my SEO career so far
Consider how easy Google make working out if you use Japster or another A.I content provider they could make it so all sites have to have installed a code to allow say the Search console to work meaning they could possibly track if you use Jasper or something else quite easy overall.
Lets say we want to sell a website today it's made from pure A.I content do you think many people will buy if they can tell this ? probably not since it can just be made by  the person thinking of buying it quite easy overall unless it's good a very good onpage SEO offpage SEO stuff
What do I think will happen in the future to A.I many things it could simple mean the sites on Google get fully disindexed or lower ranking giving to them Google is all about the money meaning if people do SEO without buying Adwords or paying Google another way they will probably cut it off often
spinned content used to exist on moneysites when Google was a lot less advanced as such spinning does not work to well anymore but it used to in the past and I kind of suspect A.I will experience same fate as like A.I from money site uses overall but copied content will still rank in some cases or A.I but I feel over time it will stop working more and more in the future over to much popularity of A.I  which will I suspect send signals to the search engines to make them less likely to work further or as long term SEO content approch overall
